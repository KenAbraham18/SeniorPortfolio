      <p>
        My name is Ken Abraham, I am a senior in Freehold High school. I am also in the web design
        program and a former social media manager for the program as well. I havenâ€™t commit to a
        college yet, but I plan on majoring in the computer science program
        for the college I go to. Something I enjoy about Web Design is the design aspect of it all, 
        I enjoy making websites look nice and pretty and proffessional rather then the part of a website 
        that makes it functional like javascript. I was born in Sharjah, UAE in April 5th, 2006. In 2009, me, my mom, 
        and my sister moved to India to live with my grandparents while my dad went to America searching for a job.
        A few months later in 2010, my family moved to Long Branch, New Jersey and I started school for the first time there.
        In 2012 my family moved to Ocean Township where I finished majority of my elementary school in. In 2015 my family moved 
        to Freehold and thats where I currently live to this day. When I graduate college I have dream of moving to Montana.
